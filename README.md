# Covariance-Matrix
In this project, the covariance matrix of a 2-dimensional vector [x, y] has been calculated, where x is the sum of m different Bernoulli random variables and y is the sum of the same random variables used for x and one more Bernoulli random variable (total of m + 1 variables).
Note: All random variables have the same distribution and are independent of each other.

# Steps:
1. The covariance matrix has been calculated.
2. The independent components of this problem have been found
3. These components are used in order to form a diagonal covariance matrix.
4. This problem is solved one more time but instead of Bernoulli, Gaussian distribution is used.
